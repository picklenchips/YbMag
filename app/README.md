# ic4-demoapp - python

Complex Python3 application originally from [ic4-examples/python/qt6/demoapp](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/ic4-examples/tree/master/python/qt6/demoapp) built with IC4 and PyQt6. 

1. Converted C++-native PySide6 dialogs from [ic4-examples/cpp/qt6/common/qt6-dialogs](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/ic4-examples/tree/master/cpp/qt6/common/qt6-dialogs) to PyQt6. 
2. Added dynamic theming support (light/dark) based on system palette and time of day.

# Setup

pip install -r ./requirements.txt
python3 ./demoapp.py
